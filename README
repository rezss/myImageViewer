Project for the San Francisco State University.

Use LEFT and RIGHT Arrow Keys to Navigate through the Pictures.
Use ENTER Key to Toggle between Fullsize and Thumbnail view. Images are located at /bin/data/
There are some example Pictures in different sizes and aspect ratios to demonstrate the resizing Function.
This Project was completely written by my own, without following a Tutorial.
